This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks to run some of the models presented in the review.

* [compare_models.ipynb](compare_models.ipynb): compare DFN, SPMe and SPM, and generate Figures 8 and 9 of the paper.
* [compare_parameters.ipynb](compare_parameters.ipynb): study the effect of parameter values by comparing Ecker 2015 and Chen 2020.
* [compare_SPMe.ipynb](compare_SPMe.ipynb): compare the outputs of the two formulations of SPMe (Marquis et al. 2019 and Richardson et al. 2020) with the DFN model.
* [exploring_dimensionality.ipynb](exploring_dimensionality.ipynb): compare the effects of dimensionality for thermal models.
* [overpotentials.ipynb](overpotentials.ipynb): plot the overpotentials for the various models.
* [particle_plot.ipynb](particle_plot.ipynb): plot the lithium concentration in the particles.
* [SPM.ipynb](SPM.ipynb): simulate the Single Particle Model.
