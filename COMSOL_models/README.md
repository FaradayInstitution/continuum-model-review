# COMSOL microscale models

This folder contains COMSOL files to run a 2D example of a microscale model. These models have been implemented by Adam Boyce (UCL) and more details can be found in

> A.M. Boyce, E. Martínez-Pañeda, A. Wade, Y.S. Zhang, J.J. Bailey, T.M.M. Heenan, D.J.L. Brett, P.R. Shearing, [Cracking predictions of lithium-ion battery electrodes by X-ray computed tomography and modelling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231119), J. Power Sources. 526 (2022).

In order to run this model you will need to have COMSOL installed. There are two different files which are compatible with COMSOL v5.6 and v6, respectively. We also include the COMSOL automatically generated report `microscale_report.pdf` to showcase the results that can be generated with the model without the need of installing COMSOL.
